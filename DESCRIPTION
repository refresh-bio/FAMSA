Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sebastian Deorowicz, Agnieszka Debudaj-Grabysz & Adam Gudyś 
Maintainer: -
Description: Algorithm for large-scale multiple sequence alignments
    (400k proteins in 2 hours and 8BG of RAM)
    Its implementation is highly optimized and parallelized 
    to make the most of modern computer platforms.
    FAMSA has the ability to import/export alignment 
    guide trees in Newick format.
